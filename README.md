At first, it was only a part of the [Yam tv App](http://bit.ly/2SxjhKD) as Scrapper that can easily get the direct streaming URL from various video hosting websites such as Fembed/Upstream/Vup.toâ€¦ and much much more but now it's a standAlone app that is connected with firebase and he can play any video at the same time from any device at the realtime.
